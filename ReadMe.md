Cave chase is a 2D platformer game that will be created using the Unity3D game engine.  

Our goals are to:
-Teach ourselves Unity
-Teach ourselves C#
-Complete a working prototype of the game concept (within the week)

Concept:
-Players will be chasing the "boss" through a series of obstacles
-Every 10-30 seconds the game will change "modes" and will switch between vertical and horizontal scrolling
-Players will be able to use a projectile weapon
-Players will die if they fall into a hazardous environment
-Players will loose health id they get hurt by an enemy
-Players will die if they loose all health
